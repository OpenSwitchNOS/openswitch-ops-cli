			   Ops-cli TODO list


This is the Ops-cli primary TODO list.  It is on git because that way changes
pass through the usual process just like code does, therefore they will have
the same visibility.

If you are working on something beyond a simple fix, to avoid double work it
is a good idea to submit a patch to this TODO list when you are starting,
listing what you're doing.  Also, as others may have done just that, check
the list before starting.
